------------Name attributes of HTTP protocol makes it difficult to use for real time systems.-----------



The problem with the HTTP protocol is that it is stateless that means that
the server receives a request responds to that and then throughs the request
away. So the server after responding to a request and thrown the request has
no way to reach out to the client again. So polling and long polling came
in to the game(see 02_polling).
