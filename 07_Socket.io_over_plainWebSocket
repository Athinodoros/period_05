Using libraries like Socket.io etc. you can gain some very useful functionality
and connection handling for free.

For example if we use pure WebSocket libraries and wwe try to upgrade from http
to socket connection and the server replies positive and a connection among the
browser and the server is established everything is great but if we try that from
a browser that doesn't support webSockets then :( nothing is great the connection fails
and the web-application fails to communicate with the client.

On the other hand using a library like Socket.IO would try to connect the sever and the
client with webSockets and if that fails then it will establish a connection with
polling or long-polling so that the full-duplex communication is there but
a little bit more expensive. The important thing is that we have a happy user :P
