---------What is HTTP streaming, SSE (Server sent events)?---------




1) Server Sent Events (SSE)

Server-sent events (SSE) is a technology where a browser receives automatic
updates from a server via HTTP connection.

Server-sent events is a standard describing how servers can initiate
data transmission towards clients once an initial client connection
has been established. They are commonly used to send message updates
or continuous data streams to a browser client and designed to enhance
native, cross-browser streaming through a JavaScript API called EventSource,
through which a client requests a particular URL in order to receive an
event stream.

2) HTTP-Streaming(aka: HTTP server push )

As a part of HTML5 the WebSocket API allows a web server and client to communicate
over a full-duplex TCP connection.Generally the web server does not terminate a
connection after response data has been served to a client. The web-server leaves
the connection open so that if an event occurs (for example, a change in internal data which needs
to be reported to one or multiple clients), it can be sent out immediately; otherwise,
the event would have to be queued until the client's next request would have been received.
