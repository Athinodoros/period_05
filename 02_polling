------------Explain polling and long-polling strategies, their pros and cons.-------------


Since HTTP is a stateless protocol and the exchange of data is half-duplex. Other ways
surfaced to achieve full-duplex client-server communication called polling and  long-polling
which emulate server-push communication.


1) Polling

With polling the client would send requests repeatedly so that it could fake a stable connection.
This way the server can always write to server as soon as it has something to send and if not the
server sends a response to say NOTHING.

Pros:-Can be used instead of webSockets on browsers that have not implemented webSockets yet.
     -(against long-polling) It doesn't keep the server busy until there is something to send.
Cons: A vast amount of data send back and forth for now reason.
      Server busy at all times even if nothing is happening.


2) Long-Polling

Long polling



Pros:-Can be used instead of webSockets on browsers that have not implemented webSockets yet.
     -(against polling) Less amount of data transmitted back and forth.(but still a lot).

Cons : A vast amount of data send back and forth for now reason.
       Server busy at all times even if nothing is happening.
