---------What is WebSocket protocol, how is it different from HTTP -----------
--------     communication, what advantages it has over HTTP?        ---------


WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it
can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket Protocol is an
independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is
interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.[1] The WebSocket protocol makes more
interaction between a browser and a website possible, facilitating the real-time data transfer
from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the
server to send content to the browser without being solicited by the client, and allowing
for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way a
two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between a browser and the server.
The communications are done over TCP port number 80, which is of benefit for those environments
which block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Similar two-way browser-server
communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet.

To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request,
for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response, as shown in the example below.

Client request (just like in HTTP, each line ends with \r\n and there must be an extra blank line at the end):

GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com

And the server responds :

HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat


After this point a full duplex communication among client and server is possible !



------------------------Explain what the WebSocket Protocol brings to the Web-world------------------------------

With webSockets a full-duplex and data inexpensive communication is possible.That opens the door to the development
of full bidirectional web applications from a simple chat to multi-player browser games and platforms like google-docs.
